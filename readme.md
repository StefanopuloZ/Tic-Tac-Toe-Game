# Tic Tac Toe Game

### Project online using GitHub Pages [here](https://stefanopuloz.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game/)

Tic Tac Toe Game is one page application of the well known two player game. As game itself has fairly simple logic main focus of this project has been UI and adittional features like replays.

Features:

- Fully functional two player Tic Tac Toe game mechanics
- Customizable player names
- Game timer and score
- Save and Load options
- Replay feature for every finished game with all of the standard user controls applied
- All games are automatically saved for later view in replay options

## Logic and Code

Game logic is not complicated here, especially if done using simple double array 3x3, completed whole logic in javascript, made html table and just proceeded from there with UI. 
I did not want to do that and I created divs, connected them with js and moved forward. It is certanly worse approach but I did it to explore what kind of problems I would encounter and to practice DOM manipulation.
